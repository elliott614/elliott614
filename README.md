- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Elliott
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Real-Time Audio DSP Software Development Applications such as FX Plugin Development, Synthesizer Design, and Emulation and Modeling
      of Tube/Analog Guitar Amplifiers circuits. I am also interested in AI + Machine Learning topics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to develop automated financial assett (i.e. stocks) trading algorithms, and/or develop analysis tools to inform myself of potential opportunities. There are so many possible approaches, and nearly every topic from electrical engineering and computer science turn out to have application in the world of finance/econometrics (signal processing, control theory, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing--e.g. for feature extraction using social media and much more.
